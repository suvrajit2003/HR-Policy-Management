‚úÖ 1. Imports & Initial Setup
js
Copy
Edit
const express = require("express");
const mongoose = require("mongoose");
const cors = require("cors");
const HrPolicy = require("./models/HRPolicy");
const SalaryIncrement = require("./models/SalaryIncrement");
const Employee = require("./models/Employee");
These lines import required modules:

express: Web framework for Node.js

mongoose: For MongoDB connection and schema handling

cors: Allows cross-origin requests (important for frontend/backend to communicate)

Models: Represent MongoDB collections

‚úÖ 2. Middleware Configuration
js
Copy
Edit
const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
app.use(cors()): Allows API access from different origins

app.use(express.json()): Parses incoming JSON data (important for POST requests)

‚úÖ 3. MongoDB Connection
js
Copy
Edit
mongoose.connect("mongodb://localhost:27017/employeeDB", {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
});
Connects to the MongoDB database employeeDB.

js
Copy
Edit
db.once("open", async () => {
  console.log("MongoDB connected");
  const existing = await HrPolicy.find();
  if (existing.length === 0) {
    await HrPolicy.create({ ... });
  }
});
After DB connects, it checks if HrPolicy collection is empty.

If yes, it inserts default HR policy data (like increment rules, milestones, etc.).

‚úÖ 4. Add Employee ‚Äì POST
js
Copy
Edit
app.post("/employees/add", async (req, res) => {
  ...
});
Client sends POST request with employee details (from a form).

req.body contains:

json
Copy
Edit
{
  "name": "John",
  "salary": 50000,
  "date_of_joining": "2022-01-01",
  ...
}
Employee is saved to DB using new Employee(req.body).save().

Then, experience is calculated using date_of_joining.

Based on experience:

js
Copy
Edit
if (>=5 years) rating = 5
else if >=3 years ‚Üí 4
else if >=2 ‚Üí 3
else if >=1 ‚Üí 2
else ‚Üí 1
A new record in SalaryIncrement is created with rating.

‚úÖ 5. Get All Employees ‚Äì GET
js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/employees", async (req, res) => {
  ...
});
Returns all employees from the database as JSON.

Used in frontend list view.

‚úÖ 6. Get HR Policy ‚Äì GET
js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/api/hr-policy", async (req, res) => {
  ...
});
Fetches the full HR policy document from MongoDB (only one exists).

Includes criteria, milestones, appraisal process.

‚úÖ 7. Get Final Salary Increments ‚Äì GET
js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/api/salary-increments", async (req, res) => {
  ...
});
Fetches all salary increment records.

For each record, it calls a model method:
emp.calculateIncrements()
(this must be defined in SalaryIncrement.js)

That method returns:

js
Copy
Edit
{
  experience: ..., // in years
  specialIncrementPercent: ...,
  totalIncrementPercent: ...,
  newSalary: ...
}
Final structured response is sent to frontend.

‚úÖ Sync SalaryIncrement ‚Äì GET
js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/api/salary-increments/sync", async (req, res) => {
  ...
});
Used to reset and regenerate the SalaryIncrement collection.

First fetches all employees

Then:

Calculates experience

Assigns new rating

Recreates SalaryIncrement documents

Useful if data changes or app is reset

‚úÖ Delete Employee ‚Äì DELETE
js
Copy
Edit
app.delete("/employees/delete/:id", async (req, res) => {
  ...
});
Deletes an employee based on their _id (MongoDB unique ID)

Used in frontend when clicking "delete" button

Ex: /employees/delete/64b3e82...

‚úÖ Server Start
js
Copy
Edit
app.listen(1000, () => {
  console.log("Server running on http://localhost:1000");
});
Starts backend server on port 1000

All your frontend Axios/API requests should point to this port
